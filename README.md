What has been done so far:
* Download and extract cpp.zip from https://github.com/wpilibsuite/GradleRIO/releases
* Download and extract `CTRE Phoenix Framework (No Installer) package 5.14.1 (.zip)` from http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources, and copy `vendordeps` into the project
* Write (untested) robot code for controlling the drive base and manipulator with a joystick/Xbox controller
